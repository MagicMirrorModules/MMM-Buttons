# MMM-Buttons

This is a module for [MagicMirror²](https://github.com/MagicMirrorOrg/MagicMirror) to act based on button presses via GPIO.

![logo](img/logo_no_screenshot.png)

It is capable of connecting multiple buttons at once, which can be individually configured.
It is basically a generalized version of the [Button module](https://github.com/PtrBld/MMM-Button), original idea comes from @PtrBld.

However it only sends out notifications to other modules.

For example this can be used to send notifications to the following modules:

- [MMM-Remote-Control](https://github.com/Jopyth/MMM-Remote-Control)
- [MMM-ProfileSwitcher](https://github.com/BigMac1999/MMM-ProfileSwitcher)

## Installation

Clone this repository into your `modules` directory:

```bash
cd ~/MagicMirror/modules # adapt directory if you are using a different one
git clone https://github.com/MagicMirrorModules/MMM-Buttons
```

That's it! No `npm install` needed - this module has no external Node.js dependencies.

**Note:**This module uses `gpiod` tools for GPIO access, which is usually pre-installed on Raspberry Pi OS. If not, you can install it with:

```bash
sudo apt install gpiod
```

## Update

To update the module, navigate to the module directory and pull the latest changes from GitHub:

```bash
cd ~/MagicMirror/modules/MMM-Buttons
git pull
```

## Configuration

Add the module to your modules array in your `config.js`.

Below is a simple example (needs [MMM-Remote-Control](https://github.com/Jopyth/MMM-Remote-Control) installed), with two buttons connected, on pins 24 and 25.

One switches on the display on a short press, and switches it off on a long press.
The other does not do anything on a short press, but shuts down the system after keeping it pressed for 3 seconds with an explanatory user alert.

```js
    {
      module: "MMM-Buttons",
      position: "bottom_left",
      config: {
        buttons: [
          {
            pin: 25,
            name: "monitor_control",
            longPress: [
              {
                title: "Monitor off",
                message: "Keep pressed for 3 seconds to switch the monitor down",
                imageFA: "display",
                notification: "REMOTE_ACTION",
                payload: {action: "MONITOROFF"}
              }
            ],
            shortPress: [
              {
                notification: "REMOTE_ACTION",
                payload: {action: "MONITORON"}
              }
            ]
          },
          {
            pin: 24,
            name: "power",
            longPress: [
              {
                title: "Power off",
                message: "Keep pressed for 3 seconds to shut down",
                imageFA: "power-off",
                notification: "REMOTE_ACTION",
                payload: {action: "SHUTDOWN"}
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    },
```

### Module Configuration

Here is full documentation of options for the modules configuration:

| Option        | Description   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `buttons` | An array of button configurations. See [Button Configuration](README.md#Button-Configuration) below. Default is `[]` (no buttons registered). |
| `minShortPressTime` | Minimum duration to trigger a short press in `ms`. Default is `0`. |
| `maxShortPressTime` | Maximum duration to trigger a short press in `ms`. Default is `1000`. |
| `minLongPressTime` | Minimum time needed to trigger a long press in `ms`. Default is `3000`. Any press duration between `maxShortPressTime` and `minLongPressTime` does not do anything. |
| `bounceTimeout` | Hardware debounce in milliseconds passed to `gpiomon` (`-p` flag). |
| `debugLimit` | How many events to keep in the debug list. Default is `5`. |

**Debug View:** If you set a `position` for the module (e.g., `position: "bottom_left"`), a debug list will be displayed showing recent button events with timing and actions. This is useful for testing your button setup. Remove the `position` to hide the debug view.

### Button Configuration

Each button configuration is an object with the following properties:

| Property      | Description   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `pin` | Pin number of the button input (use [**BCM** numbering](http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/a/12967)). |
| `name` | Name of the button for easier identification and log output. |
| `activeLow` | Set to `true` if your button is active low (connects to GND when pressed, which is the typical setup with internal pull-up resistors). Set to `false` for active high buttons. Default is `true`. |
| `longPress` | Choose what notification to send on a long press. See [Notification Configuration](README.md#Notification-Configuration) below. Omit if nothing should trigger. |
| `shortPress` | Choose what notification to send on a short press. See [Notification Configuration](README.md#Notification-Configuration) below. Omit if nothing should trigger. |

### Notification Configuration

Each notification configuration is an array of objects with the following properties:

| Property      | Description   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `notification` | Notification name. |
| `payload` | Notification payload. Can be anything, for example a `string` or an `object`. |
| `title`, `message`, and `imageFA` | *Optional (only for long press notifications):* If you want to display a message before executing set its options here. See [Alert documentation](https://github.com/MagicMirrorOrg/MagicMirror/tree/master/modules/default/alert#alert-params) for their meaning. |

**Alert Examples:**

| Monitor Off | Shutdown |
